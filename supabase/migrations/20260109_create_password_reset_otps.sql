-- Migration removed: OTP-based password reset is not used in this project.
-- If you previously applied this migration, you'll need to drop the
-- `password_reset_otps` table manually from the database if desired.

-- NOTE: Keep a copy of the original migration in version control if you
-- may want to reintroduce OTP flow later. This file has been neutralized.
